        description: "The Davis-Horton House (formerly known as the William Heath Davis House) built in 1850, is the oldest standing structure in Downtown San Diego. It serves as the home of the Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation (GQHF) and the Gaslamp Museum at the Davis-Horton House.

        Originally, the house was one of several saltbox-style structures shipped from Portland, Maine, to San Diego, which had little wood for construction due to a lack trees along the coast.  

        The houses were intended to comprise the first settlement in what was then called “New Town.” The structures were erected near what is now State and Market Streets near San Diego’s oldest public park, Pantoja Park.

        In 1873, Anna Scheper purchased the house after it had been moved from State and Market to Eleventh and K Streets. Anna contracted with San Diego County to run the house as the “County Hospital.” She earned $1.00 per patient per day.
        
        Today, the Davis-Horton House welcomes thousands of visitors annually.

        description: "
        Throughout the 1880s, the property changed hands many times. In the early 1900s, the Excelsior Soda Works, an established bottling company, formerly on India Street since 1893, constructed a new bottling works factory at 557 Fourth Avenue. In 1908, the property once more changed hands. Henry Krotzer leased the vacated bottling works to H. Lynell, who used the building as a furniture and auctioneering business.

        The present building, 551 Fourth Avenue, was constructed between 1910 and 1914.  The structure, a three-story brick building, consists of 40 hotel rooms with multiple lightwells, a 5,000 square foot basement with redwood rafters and several street level stores.

        Between 1914 and 1930, the hotel was first the New York Hotel and then the Midland. The early street level businesses were varied. Between 1917 and 1928, many Chinese companies, including the Golden Gate Company, occupied the space at 555 Fourth Avenue and used it primarily for storage of their excess goods. 

        Things became more lively in 1925 when the Pacifica Dance Hall moved into the space at 547. The Pacifica remained a tenant until 1928.
        
        The Pacifica Hotel has undergone many changes, rebrandings and resurrections since 1910, and after many soil and earthquake tests is now listed as one of the safest buildings in the Gaslamp.

        description: "Albert A. Cole, an early San Diego capitalist, purchased the property from Alonzo Horton in December of 1868 for $900 in gold coin. In 1873, Cole deeded a portion of the property to Charles Snider for $1,250 in gold, netting himself a tidy profit.

        By 1892, the successful Mr. Cole decided to replace the one-story frame building with a three-story brick building. He hired prominent architect, John B. Stannard to design the structure. Stannard had also designed the Sherman-Gilbert House, the Louis Bank of Commerce, the Minear Building, the Nanking Cafe, and the Callan Hotel.
        
        At the close of construction none of these companies received any remuneration and were finally forced to take legal action. As a result of these financial woes and a bad case of the grippe (old fashioned term for influenza), Cole died by suicide. The cost of the building was $35,000, and Mr. Cole’s net worth was in excess of $100,000, so it was speculated that his money woes and flu could not have been the sole cause of his untimely death.

        According to the manager of the current establishment, Jerry Lopez, this lively and popular venue also appears to be haunted, as several very unusual occurrences have happened in his office late at night after closing. Additionally, before Whiskey Girl took over the venue, a manager of the previous business, La Strada, quit her job after claiming to have seen a fully manifested apparition.

The upstairs of the building has operated as rented rooms under the names of the Cotheret, Ardmore, and Gaslamp Hotel. The Canary Cottage, run by San Diego's most notorious madam, Ida Bailey, was located behind this very structure. The narrow alley found to the right of the building provided Bailey's patrons access to the cottage and the Fan Tan Gambling House.

His first endeavor was the iconic Backesto Building on 5th and Market. In 1887, excavation began on the “New Backesto Building.” The projected cost of the three story, brick structure was $26,000. 

        During construction, the first floor collapsed into the basement. As a result of this untimely event, the City Trustees modified the city building ordinances to ensure safer buildings. The contractor and his wary crew then raised the first floor out of the basement and replaced the brick supports which had failed with iron and wooden ones. 
        
        On the morning of September 4, 1888 fire totally destroyed the new Backesto Building. It was described by the San Diego Union as the most disastrous fire in San Diego’s history. Spectators had to flee for their lives, but fortunately all tenants escaped and no loss of life occurred. Owners Klauber and Levi lost their entire stock valued at $250,000.
        
        Throughout the years, the building, now known as the Broker’s Building, has had numerous tenants including newspaper offices, wholesalers, labor union offices, restaurants, pool halls, a locker club, a barber college and carpet and drapery businesses. In 1948, an elevator was installed and the cupola was removed. However, the original cast iron columns remained intact.

        description: "Tillman Burns was the first “zookeeper” in San Diego - a colorful businessman and barkeep in the downtown Gaslamp District. 

        Till’s menagerie, consisted of tropical birds of every sort - numerous primates, an iguana, tarantula spiders, a porcupine and a rather ill-tempered bear named Bruin, which he chained outside. Additionally, there was a cabinet of curiosities from all over the world and newspapers from all the large Eastern cities. For those who were desirous of feminine company, colorfully dressed ladies drifted in and out of the back rooms, while the finest liquors were served freely at the bar.

        Things became really difficult for Till when his bear purportedly bit off most of Constable Wilbur’s nose. The lawman, whom many said was quite handsome, ran down the street to the doctor, who told him that anyone who was foolish enough to stick his face up to a bear deserved to get bitten. The local populace now demanded that Mr. Burns get rid of his zoo, so Till turned them loose at the edge of town.

        As the Asian community was becoming more commercially active, the Nippon Company gained control of the larger storefront in 1914, and ultimately purchased the property in 1926. The upstairs was run as the Hotel Pacific. It provided furnished rooms and office space for a variety of businesses – all Japanese. The Japanese Association of San Diego County, additionally, had their offices at the Pacific.

        In 1941, under the direction of President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, all Japanese were sent to internment camps and the property was seized by the bank. The San Diego Federal Savings and Loan Company became owner and reopened the hotel in 1943 under the name of Hotel Callan, which it retains to this day.

Old City Hall, a stunning example of Florentine Revival architecture, first made its debut as a two story building housing the Commercial Bank. It has the distinction of being the first building in the Gaslamp to be constructed of all local materials. 

        On July 15, 1882 the San Diego Public Library moved into the second floor bringing with them 7,000 volumes. On the east side of the room was the gentleman’s reading room and reference library. The northwest corner provided for a ladies reading room, which was separated from the main room by a screen.

        The City of San Diego had been looking for a suitable building for a City Hall; the deal was agreed upon, and in 1899, all the city offices moved in.

        The first mayor to have his office at the new City Hall was Edwin Capps, who unfortunately became embroiled in a scandal involving profit making on the purchase of smallpox vaccine intended for public use. He apparently weathered the storm, as he was re-elected in 1915. Always controversial, his second term was marred by a “rainmaker” fiasco. San Diego was suffering a multi-year drought, and hearing that a rainmaker had previously been successful in Los Angeles, the Mayor hired Charley Hatfield to end the drought. Mr. Hatfield avowed that the City need not pay him if he didn’t achieve his goal. After he seeded the clouds with noxious fumes, rain began to fall, and continued to fall. In January of 1916, San Diego experienced severe flooding and reneged on the deal with Hatfield.

        In 1920, while he was Mayor, Wilde hosted a grand debutante ball at the Hotel Del Coronado for his daughter, Lucille. One of the most famous men to visit San Diego, the Prince of Wales, was an attendee at the gala. To get even with his political enemies and others who had snubbed him, Wilde simply did not invite them to come and meet this famous guest.

        The first tenants of this impressive structure included clothiers, milliners, jewelers, a liquor store, general merchandisers, a hardware store, real estate offices, a photographer’s studio, ship chandlers and steamship companies.  The upper floors housed 39 sleeping rooms.  Klauber and Levi, San Diego’s pioneer grocer and general merchandise firms occupied the building until 1886, and the famous San Diego Hardware opened in this building in 1892. In 1923, San Diego Hardware moved to a building further up Fifth Avenue.

Although the organization was active in England as far back as the 1700s, the American branch was not organized until 1819 by Thomas Wildey in Baltimore, Maryland. During the period between 1862 – 1920, they were the largest of all fraternal organizations. 

        On March 7, 1882, the cornerstone for the IOOF building was laid. A casket shaped box, as was the custom of the Odd Fellows, was placed in the northeast corner. It contained Masonic and I.O.O.F. documents, newspapers, coins, historical data, a piece of wood from Lebanon, and a piece of stone from Solomon’s Temple. To celebrate the occasion, a joint parade was held by both organizations, which started up D Street (now Broadway), down D Street to 6th Street and down 6th to H Street (now Market Street). The City Guard Brass Band played and the parade was followed by numerous speeches, and finally culminated with the laying of the casket.

        Throughout the years, the first floor has housed saloons, wholesale and retail liquor stores, gun shops, book stores, a seed store, dry goods stores, billiard parlors, barbers, tobacco stores, a laundry, shoe repair shops, restaurants, a chili con carne factory and the Wells Fargo Express Company. In 1974, the San Diego Ballet used the second floor, with its elegant wood floors as their headquarters.

        Throughout its colorful history the I.O.O.F. building has hosted many dignitaries, but perhaps one of the most notable was King Kalakaua of Hawaii. He arrived in 1890, as he was touring the mainland and there was talk of Hawaii becoming a state.  He sat by one of the magnificent arched windows and, unfortunately and literally, caught his death of a cold.

Often referred to as ‘the Noble Experiment’ because of its ultimate failure as a law, this time of secret knocks, whispered passwords and hidden bars still holds a certain charm for cocktail enthusiasts today. Speakeasy-style bars that evoke the mysterious allure of this famous time in history have become popular across major US cities.

        One of the most highly rated speakeasies both for cocktail quality and an authentic Prohibition-era feel in San Diego, California is aptly named The Noble Experiment, located in downtown San Diego’s famous Gaslamp District. Located behind a secret door that appears to be a stack of old beer kegs within the upbeat, casual restaurant Neighborhood Alehouse, and accepting of only very specific reservation methods, this unusual bar is the Gaslamp District’s best-kept secret.
        
        Attire is smart; men will not be allowed in with caps, sandals or shorts, and collared shirts are preferred. Women should embrace the theme as well and arrive in their classy best. Because of the limited seating capacity, reservations are a must. Reservations are recommended to be made one week in advance for Friday and Saturday nights, and one day ahead for weeknights. The reservation style follows the enigmatic feel of the bar. Noble Experiment’s website features nothing more than a picture of a key and a phone number; guests must text this number at precisely one minute after midnight to obtain a reservation. Walk-ins are sometimes accommodated, but reservations are strongly recommended, especially for groups larger than two.

        description: "Rendezvous, The Wonder Bar was established by THE US GRANT’s then-owner, Baron Long, in 1933 just after Prohibition was repealed. Today, the spirit of the 1930s Rendezvous has been reignited with its un retour triomphant. The new French-inspired cocktail bar inside the historic US GRANT Hotel reintroduces the city to a level of service and an attention to detail that some may think had been consigned to the past, in a casual setting that welcomes you to stay a while.
