        description: "The Davis-Horton House (formerly known as the William Heath Davis House) built in 1850, is the oldest standing structure in Downtown San Diego. It serves as the home of the Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation (GQHF) and the Gaslamp Museum at the Davis-Horton House.

        Originally, the house was one of several saltbox-style structures shipped from Portland, Maine, to San Diego, which had little wood for construction due to a lack trees along the coast.  A saltbox structure takes its name from its resemblance to the wooden lidded box in which salt was once kept. Typically, a saltbox structure has just one story in the back and two stories in the front. A long pitched roof that slopes down to the back, flat front and central chimney are also recognizable features.

        The houses were intended to comprise the first settlement in what was then called “New Town.” The structures were erected near what is now State and Market Streets near San Diego’s oldest public park, Pantoja Park.

        In 1873, Anna Scheper purchased the house after it had been moved from State and Market to Eleventh and K Streets. Anna contracted with San Diego County to run the house as the “County Hospital.” She earned $1.00 per patient per day.

        A late owner, George Deyo inherited the house in the 1930s and passed it on to the Lanuza Family in 1977, who in turn, donated the house to the City of San Diego to become a museum. The house was moved to its current location when the museum restoration began. Electricity was installed for the first time in 1984, and 17 layers of wallpaper were peeled back to reveal earlier décor. Former Museum Curator Mary Joralmon worked tirelessly to restore the house to its current state as a museum for visitors to enjoy.

        Each room in the house depicts a period in its history: from its first use as a pre-Civil War military officers’ barracks, to a county hospital, to a private residence. Various individuals have occupied the home, including: Alonzo Horton, considered the “Father of San Diego,” an alleged German spy, and several families. The Davis-Horton House is the only home in which Horton lived that is still standing.

        Today, the Davis-Horton House welcomes thousands of visitors annually.

        description: "In 1867, Alonzo Horton sold to A.S. Seely, a mail carrier from Los Angeles, a one half interest of the original Pacifica Hotel property site , which included spaces 547-557. Mr. Seely paid Mr. Horton $25.00. The owner of the other half of the property was unknown.


        Throughout the 1880s, the property changed hands many times, and the structures at the site were a series of small wooden buildings. In the early 1900s, the Excelsior Soda Works, an established bottling company, formerly on India Street since 1893, constructed a new bottling works factory at 557 Fourth Avenue. In 1908, the property once more changed hands. This time Henry Krotzer purchased the property for “next to nothing” according to the local news sources. Krotzer leased the vacated bottling works to H. Lynell, who used the building as a furniture and auctioneering business.



        The present building, 551 Fourth Avenue, was constructed between 1910 and 1914.  The structure, a three-story brick building, consists of 40 hotel rooms with multiple lightwells, a 5,000 square foot basement with redwood rafters and several street level stores. In the basement was a steam boiler used for heating and hot water, which remained in use until 2003. Although it has been replaced by a more modern appliance, the boiler is still in the basement.



        Between 1914 and 1930, the hotel was first the New York Hotel and then the Midland. The early street level businesses were varied. Between 1917 and 1928, many Chinese companies, including the Golden Gate Company, occupied the space at 555 Fourth Avenue and used it primarily for storage of their excess goods. Additionally, a Chinese restaurant was also a tenant.



        Things became more lively in 1925 when the Pacifica Dance Hall moved into the space at 547. The Pacifica remained a tenant until 1928.



        The hotel, meanwhile, was rebranded as the Service Hotel in 1930, since it provided housing for the military.



        By 1960, the hotel had been condemned by the City for lack of secondary fire exits in the back of the building. It remained boarded up until 1967, when it was purchased by Jim and Violet Seery , with a loan from Home Federal Savings and Loan. At that point, it had deteriorated into more than just a “fixer upper.” The hotel had broken windows, pigeons nesting in rooms, and old and molding furniture and fabric coverings throughout. The basement had approximately five to six inches of standing water in some places, and was stacked with old furniture. After extensive restoration, much of it done by the Seerys themselves, plus the addition of fire escapes in the rear of the building, the Seery Hotel opened in 1969. It remained the Seery Hotel until 1981.



        As the Seerys were nearing retirement age, they sold the hotel to Mohan and Kanchan Bakta, and in 1981 the Seery Hotel was renamed the Pacifica Hotel.



        The Baktas have continually lived on the property, where they raised five children. The hotel , now primarily a residential hotel, features vintage furniture, shared baths, laundry facilities and many thoughtful amenities such as daily newspapers and washbasins in each room.



        Cafe Sevilla, a popular Spanish restaurant and tapas bar, opened its doors in space 555 in 1984, and remained in that spot until 2016, when it moved to a larger location on Fifth Avenue. With its signature flamenco show, it is one of the most popular nightclubs in the Gaslamp.



        In 1981, Kit Goldman opened the Gaslamp Quarter Theater in the space once occupied by the Pacifica Dance Hall. This was not without some contentious backlash from Mr. Tom Wen Tang, who had lived on the property for 50 years and was not pleased at having to find a new venue in which  to play Mahjong! Ms. Goldman , who featured innovative drama and encouraged local talent, was managing director from 1980-1990. The theater, which had expanded from its humble beginning in the 99 seat, non-air conditioned venue to a second location at the much larger and more modern Hahn Cosmopolitan Theater saw its original founders and principals retire in 1990.



        The Pacifica Hotel has undergone many changes , rebrandings and resurrections since 1910, and after many soil and earthquake tests is now listed as one of the safest buildings in the Gaslamp. The Baktas remain in residence, and the hotel continues to provide dependable, comfortable service to its residents and visitors.

        description: "The site of the current Cole Building, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and “G” Street, is one of the earliest developed properties in the area. Albert A. Cole, an early San Diego capitalist, purchased the property from Alonzo Horton in December of 1868 for $900 in gold coin. In 1873, Cole deeded a portion of the property to Charles Snider for $1,250 in gold, netting himself a tidy profit.

        At the same time, Mr. Cole had a frame building well under construction on the site. This building, a one-story wood frame structure, had three storefronts with frame partitions and slate or tin roofs. Businesses in the storefronts included a grocery, a restaurant and a fruit stand. Another tenant was Theodore Verlaque, a native of France, who was intent on opening a place for the sale of liquor and wines. In 1879, Verlaque took out a two-year lease from Mr. Cole, and promptly subleased the property to Theodore Lehmann for nearly twice the amount of money he was paying Cole! Verlaque was not only a successful restauranteur, saloon keeper and wine maker, he also ran large herds of sheep from the hills of La Jolla to the Narrows, which is now part of Anza-Borrego State Park. He foresaw future growth in that area, and with a fellow Basque, August Grand, he established the Verlaque Store, the first business and built the first house in what was to become the city of Ramona. Verlaque’s children remained in the area and ran the store until 1960. Both structures are still standing and are preserved as historical landmarks in Ramona.

        In 1882, Cole decided to expand his property and built yet another store on the site. Charles Snider was also still active on his side of the property and had expanded to a barber shop and bathhouse. The city directory at the time lists the barber shop as Snider’s and the bathhouse as his wife’s business. C.F. Francisco’s grocery store opened in Cole’s new building, and as he promised to “have a neat assortment of fresh goods from San Francisco,” he received a rush of business from local customers.

        By 1892, the successful Mr. Cole decided to, once again, expand his holdings. He planned to replace the one-story frame building with a three-story brick building. He hired prominent architect, John B. Stannard to design the structure. Stannard had also designed the Sherman-Gilbert House, the Louis Bank of Commerce, the Minear Building, the Nanking Cafe, and the Callan Hotel. Additionally, he designed the glass dome for Madam Tingley’s Theosophical Society in Point Loma and a fire station at 25th and Broadway.

        Stannard described his proposed project as being a symmetrically arranged structure with cream colored bricks set in red mortar. He allowed for three large storerooms on the Fifth Avenue side of the building and one storeroom on the “G” Street side. The main entrance to the second and third floor rooms was to be on “G” Street and would feature a perfectly formed arch with a wide stairway of Oregon pine finished in white cedar ascending to the upper floors. Stannard envisioned 24 rooms on each floor, all arranged exactly alike. The interior was also to be finished in white cedar. He incorporated granite keystones in the arch and the use of Arizona red sandstone for the windowsills. The keystones are unique in the Gaslamp, and not found on any other buildings. The elaborate roofline was to feature large pinnacles.

        Albert Cole hired Thomas Jobbitt and Peter F. Schaniel to construct the building. Jobbitt and Schaniel ordered materials from Whittier-Fuller and Company, San Diego Paint Company, Olsen, Graham and Weldon and West Coast Lumber in Cole’s name. In most cases, Cole made a minimum down payment with no terms discussed for the remainder of the costs. At the close of construction none of these companies received any remuneration and were finally forced to take legal action. As a result of these financial woes and a bad case of the grippe (old fashioned term for influenza), Cole committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. The cost of the building was $35,000, and Mr. Cole’s net worth was in excess of $100,000, so it was speculated that his money woes and flu could not have been the sole cause of his untimely death.

        Eventually, the Cole estate settled the debts and the administration of the estate was granted to Cole’s wife, Maria. She also continued to improve the property. As Cole’s brothers and sisters expected some compensation from the estate, Mrs. Cole bought them out for $42,000 and retained full control of the property.

        In 1892, Mrs. Cole sold a portion of the land to Ralph Granger for $22,000 in gold coin. Besides his commercial interests, Granger founded a musical conservatory at his house in Paradise Valley. He also owned one of the finest rare violin collections in the world. The house, now known as Granger Hall, is a historic landmark in National City.

        Prior to the turn of the last century, tenants of the Cole Building included the Lion Clothing Company and the Coronado View Hotel. In 1899, Samuel I. Fox bought the Lion Clothing Company, and moved the business to his new building on 6th and Broadway. The Coronado View remained until 1925, and subsequently became the Welcome Hotel and then the Kelsey Hotel. Sam Lesinsky, another clothier, followed Lion’s and remained until 1922.

        Maria H. Cole died on September 15, 1924.  At her death, the Cole property was listed at having a value of $90,000. This parcel and several others were to be held in trust for 25 years by the Southern Trust and Commerce Bank. When the trust elapsed, the bulk of the estate was to be given to various charities, which Mrs. Cole had previously supported.

        Throughout the ensuing years, a variety of businesses operated on the property. Some of the more interesting were the People’s Fish Company, the Owl Loan Company and the Palm Cafe.

        The current occupant on the street level of the property is a popular sports bar, restaurant and nightclub named Whiskey Girl. According to the manager, Jerry Lopez, this lively and popular venue also appears to be haunted, as several very unusual occurrences have happened in his office late at night after closing. Additionally, before Whiskey Girl took over the venue, a manager of the previous business, La Strada, quit her job after claiming to have seen a fully manifested apparition. Nothing unusual in many of these old buildings with colorful histories! Whiskey Girl also owns the Double Deuce, another popular bar in the Gaslamp.

        description: "It has been said that some people are born lucky and some are not.  And – to that end, there is an old saying – “I’d rather be lucky than good.” The original Broker’s Building was neither.

        On December 23, 1867, John P. Backesto, a physician from  San Jose, purchased Lots E and F from Alonzo Horton. By 1873, Dr. Backesto started building on his property. His first endeavor was the iconic Backesto Building on 5th and Market. In 1887, excavation began on the “New Backesto Building.” The projected cost of the three story, brick structure was $26,000. The architects were G.T. Burkett of San Jose and R.E. Osgood of San Diego. The building contract was let to William F. Fitzpatrick. So far, so good.

        Unfortunately, during construction, the first floor collapsed into the basement. This was particularly disastrous as 60 tons of hardware belonging to Klauber and Levi, the future first tenants, went with it. Much hysteria and panic ensued as it was rumored that some of the workmen had been crushed in the collapse. Fortunately, the rumor proved untrue. However, as a result of this untimely event, the City Trustees modified the city building ordinances to ensure safer buildings. The contractor and his wary crew then raised the first floor out of the basement and replaced the brick supports which had failed with iron and wooden ones. Upon completion, the Klauber and Levi Company moved in from their original location on Seventh and “I” St. They were San Diego’s first large grocery emporium and were wholesalers of not only groceries, but also wine, liquor, cigars, tobacco, drugs, patent medicines, woodware, heavy hardware, carriage and wagon materials, agricultural implements, iron and steel – one-stop shopping! Mr. Klauber, an Austrian immigrant, came to California in 1852 and worked at gold mining. With the profits from his gold mining ventures, he came to San Diego and established Klauber and Steiner, general merchants with a San Franciscan, Mr. Steiner.  Steiner, who was in charge of purchasing, remained in San Francisco. In 1876, Simon Levi, a Bohemian immigrant, joined the firm. He had previously run a general store in Temecula. In 1883, Steiner retired and the firm became Klauber and Levi. Klauber and Levi first occupied a portion of the Backesto Building on Fifth Avenue, before moving into the ill-fated New Backesto Building in 1887.

        The second floor of the building was occupied by  various business offices, including lawyers, contractors and a steamship agent. The third floor was home to the Lake Shore Hotel and residential rooms.

        Unfortunately, all that was well did not end well. On the morning of September 4, 1888 fire totally destroyed the new Backesto Building. It was described by the San Diego Union as the most disastrous fire in San Diego’s history. The fire had apparently started in the basement from unknown causes, and was discovered by a clerk when he came to work in the morning. The fire department tried to put out the flames, but they were hampered by poor water pressure and an explosion in the basement, which tore off the north half of the building and caused it to collapse into the street. Spectators had to flee for their lives, but fortunately all tenants escaped and no loss of life occurred.However, the loss of possessions was total. Klauber and Levi lost their entire stock valued at $250,000.

        Klauber and Levi were not to be deterred. They re-opened their business at their original location, and remained there until a new building was built on Fourth and “H.” This building, built on the ashes of the previous one, again built by Dr. Backesto, was erected specifically for Klauber and Levi. Simon Levi assisted in the planning of the structure, which was to serve as a model for wholesale purposes. The architect was Mr. Barnett McDougal of San Diego.

        This new building also got off to a bad start. Bad luck again! The Board of Public Works denied its building permits, as the plans did not meet current building ordinance standards. Dr. Backesto wanted to use wooden columns instead of the iron as prescribed by law. Eventually, upon the advice of the Fire Chief and the Underwriter’s Association, a modification was made and construction was allowed to proceed with cast iron columns from the Coronado Foundry. The building was two stories high,100 x 100 , and crowned with a cupola. A third story was added in 1909.

        In 1889, Klauber and Levi moved in, and were the only tenants until 1903. In 1895, Simon Levi left the company to start his own business, and Julius Wangenheim entered as a partner. The new business became known as the Klauber Wangenheim Company. Wangenheim, a former engineer for the Southern Pacific Railroad, married one of Abraham Klauber’s daughters and became actively involved in the development of Balboa Park and other civic endeavors. After Abraham Klauber’s death in 1911, his son, Melville Klauber became president of the company, which remained in the building until 1929.

        Throughout the years , the building , now known as the Broker’s Building, has had numerous tenants including newspaper offices, wholesalers, labor union offices, restaurants, pool halls, a locker club, a barber college and carpet and drapery businesses. In 1948, an elevator was installed and the cupola was removed. However, the original cast iron columns remained intact.

        In more modern times, the building was the home of Hooters, a restaurant chain on the street level and the Broker’s Building Art Gallery and artist’s studios on the upper levels. The tall windows, reflective of Victorian architecture,  provide maximum light suitable for painting and photographic arts. Additionally, it hosted the Haunted Hotel, a novelty attraction, once a year. It is currently unoccupied and being remodeled, with the space formerly occupied by Hooters projected to be Draft, a brewery and restaurant. It is a classic example of re-purposing an older building to serve a modern purpose, while still maintaining its historic character and facade.

        description: "The first “zookeeper” in San Diego, was a colorful businessman and barkeep in the downtown Gaslamp District. His name was Tillman Burns, or Till for short. Till first owned the Phoenix, a drinking establishment on 5th and K, but then decided to move further uptown to 5th and Island, where he set about opening the Acme, a most elegant saloon and billiards parlor.

        The first building on this property was a wooden structure owned by William Llewelyn, who purchased the property from Alonzo Horton in 1869. He added a pump and well the following year for fire prevention. The well was of little help, as the building burned down in 1877.  Mr. Llewelyn then constructed a brick building on the site. This sturdy, but not architecturally significant edifice, had two storefronts, the larger one on the corner facing 5th Avenue. It was to this site that Till Burns and his menagerie arrived.

        Till’s menagerie, which he began assembling at the Phoenix, consisted of tropical birds of every sort, numerous primates, an iguana, tarantula spiders, a porcupine and a rather ill-tempered bear named Bruin, which he chained outside. It was Till’s belief that these exotic creatures would tempt customers to come into his saloon. His saloon was described in the City Directory as containing reading rooms, an elegant bar, reception rooms, a billiard parlor and magnificent oil paintings. Additionally, there was a cabinet of curiosities from all over the world and newspapers from all the large Eastern cities. For those who were desirous of feminine company, colorfully dressed ladies drifted in and out of the back rooms, while the finest liquors were served freely at the bar. Unfortunately, Till was often cited in the newspapers for serving liquor without a license and keeping his bar open after midnight.

        Things became really difficult for Till when his bear purportedly bit off most of Constable Wilbur’s nose. The lawman, whom many said was quite handsome, ran down the street to the doctor, who told him that anyone who was foolish enough to stick his face up to a bear deserved to get bitten.  With that, the doctor turned him away, as there was nothing he felt he could do. The local populace now demanded that Mr. Burns get rid of his zoo, so Till turned them loose at the edge of town.

        Till Burns ran the Acme until his death in 1904, at which time his son, also named Till, took over. Till Jr. ran the saloon until 1909. The property continued to be run as a saloon until 1914 by Louis Strada and A. Costanzi, who purchased the building from William Llewelyn, and added the upper two stories. Strada and Costanzi also ran the adjoining storefront as a saloon and a speakeasy during Prohibition until 1926 .

        As the Asian community was becoming more commercially active, the Nippon Company gained control of the larger storefront in 1914, and ultimately purchased the property in 1926. The Nippon Company, an import business, used the storefront as their sales outlet and headquarters. The upstairs was run as the Hotel Pacific. It provided furnished rooms and office space for a variety of businesses – all Japanese. The Japanese Association of San Diego County, additionally, had their offices at the Pacific.

        In 1941, under the direction of President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, all Japanese were sent to internment camps and the property was seized by the bank. The San Diego Federal Savings and Loan Company became owner and reopened the hotel in 1943 under the name of Hotel Callan, which it retains to this day.

        During the early part of the Gaslamp restoration, a colorful and historically themed mural adorned the Island Avenue side of the building.  Created by Heidi Hardin, the mural featured an idyllic scene of El Monte Park in Lakeside at the turn of the last century.  The nine-foot tall figures, each representing a Gaslamp pioneer, appear as if they are getting their picture taken. Among the characters are Tom Hom, Wayne Donaldson, Dan Pearson, Kit Goldman, Mario Torero, also an accomplished artist, Larry Nichols, Ben Parish and the artist herself!  Ms. Hardin’s mural was the largest of the five commissioned by the Gaslamp Mural Project, who selected five artists from 71 applicants to adorn five sites in the Gaslamp. In completing her work, she recruited some of the local residents of the 5th Avenue Rescue Mission. A local Carl’s Junior donated 80 hamburgers, Hardin bought the French fries and anyone who wanted to paint was put to work. Now, an accomplished artist with her own gallery in San Francisco, Ms. Hardin credits her start as an artist to the mural project. Her latest endeavor is The Human Family/A Walk Through Paradise, which incorporates seven rooms and an elaborate stained glass dome as a focal point.

        The Callan is currently a low-income single-room occupancy residence on the upper two stories, and a restaurant, Sab Lai Thai, on the street level. The Blarney Stone, a tavern, occupies the smaller adjoining storefront.

        description: "As with most lots sold during the early Horton years, the site of Old City Hall was purchased from Alonzo Horton on December 23, 1867 by John P. Backesto . In fact, Dr. Backesto, a physician from San Jose, purchased the entire block for the sum of $300 in gold. Dr. Backesto immediately started sub-dividing the property , and on July 15, 1873, the newly organized Commercial Bank purchased one of his lots for $500 in gold coin. Not a bad profit for Dr. Backesto, as his property had been subdivided into many lots!

        Old City Hall, a stunning example of Florentine Revival architecture, first made its debut as a two story building housing the Commercial Bank. It has the distinction of being the first building in the Gaslamp to be constructed of all local materials. The bank hired prominent architect William Lacey of Payne and Lacey to design the edifice . Mr. Lacey went on to design the Begole Building and the Nesmith-Greeley Building.

        The lower front of the structure was of iron with castings done at the San Diego Foundry from original designs by Lacey. The doors and windows were of French plate glass and the sill courses (frames) were of Cajon granite from the Cajon Ranch, and cut by Cook Brothers stoneyards. The remainder of the building was constructed of brick. All materials used – brick, iron and stonework – were all made in San Diego. The selected contractor was William Jorres, who submitted a bid of $16,365. This included the cast iron girders he incorporated, which each weighed 2.300 pounds, and were the heaviest in the state outside of San Francisco. The tin roof was fashioned by W.A. Begole, who also happened to be a member of the building committee. Construction was completed in late May of 1874.

        The Commercial Bank merged with the Bank of San Diego, and the newly minted Consolidated Bank of San Diego moved into the north half of the ground floor. Lacey also designed the interior, which was elaborate, richly appointed, and did not disappoint.  A massive, horseshoe-shaped walnut counter dominated the room with its 16 foot ceilings and 12 foot windows. It also featured fluted Doric pilasters ( ornamental columns ) grained in Italian marble. Exposed brick walls completed the interior.

        The President’s and Director’s offices were behind the banking office. The vault, located in the southwest corner of the room, was made of a solid piece of masonry with all parts visible from the outside of the building. In the basement below the Director’s office was another office, with an additional six offices housed on the second floor.

        The south half of the ground floor was utilized by Lowenstein and Company as a retail business, with the second floor as a wholesale business. The stairway leading to the second floor featured solid walnut rails and carved balusters (lathe-turned spindles), and two passageways leading to the roof.

        The sidewalk outside the building was of asphaltum (asphalt mixed with other particulates) with a granite curb.

        On July 15, 1882 the San Diego Public Library moved into the second floor bringing with them 7,000 volumes. Four years later, Bank President Bryant Howard, approached the City Council with an urgent proposal to improve the now very crowded library facilities. The bank was already planning extensive building improvements and felt that a $50 per month rent increase would cover the cost of major library renovations. The library renovations were designed by Kentucky native, Otis Breden, who had extensive experience in designing the interiors of public buildings. The improvements featured a winding staircase leading to a Gothic- style gallery made of carved and inlaid cedar. The gallery was suspended from the ceiling on heavy iron rods encased in gilt tubing. There were 600 feet of new redwood bookcases with cedar pilasters. The cases incorporated sliding glass doors with rubber tires. This invention, by Breden, greatly mitigated the noise level in the library.

        Immediately upon the completion of the renovations, the decision was made to add two more floors and remodel the outside. The architectural design was by Comstock and Trotsche, who added a wrought iron elevator ( still operational), an imposing main entrance, and a skylight on the fourth floor. The library was moved to the fourth floor with the bookshelves now in the center of the room and enclosed by a railing with a passageway around the railing. On the east side of the room was the gentleman’s reading room and reference library. The northwest corner provided for a ladies reading room, which was separated from the main room by a screen.

        During the 1880s, there were few tenants in the building, but after the enlargement and renovations, the tenant list grew considerably. Included in the list were several legal firms, an abstract company , a contractor and the Merchants National Bank.

        In 1893, a world-wide business depression occurred, and five of San Diego’s eight banks were forced to close. The Consolidated National Bank never re-opened. All the tenants, with the exception of one attorney and the Merchants National Bank, fled. When the library moved to new headquarters at the St. James Hotel, the shelves had to be lowered to the street by a derrick. The Superior Court ordered the sale of the Consolidated Bank Building, and in 1899, Ralph Granger purchased the building for $25,000.

        The City of San Diego had been looking for a suitable building for a City Hall, and Mr. Granger made them an offer they couldn’t refuse. Since a down payment was difficult at the time, Granger suggested a high rent to be applied to a purchase at the end of five years. The ultimate purchase price would be $38,750. During the five year period the rent would be lowered incrementally. The deal was agreed upon, and in 1899, all the city offices moved in. In 1905, the purchase was finalized.

        By June of 1900, the city was at least halfway moved in. The ground floor housed the tax collector, tax assessor, City auditor, the office of Pueblo Lands and the Police Department. The offices on the second floor were designated as those of Civil Service, the Dairy Inspection Department, and the Board of Health. The offices of the City Attorney, the Water Commissioner and the City Library occupied the third floor. The fourth floor served as Council Chambers and the Mayor’s office.

        The first mayor to have his office at the new City Hall was Edwin Capps, who unfortunately became embroiled in a scandal involving profit making on the purchase of smallpox vaccine intended for public use. He apparently weathered the storm, as he was re-elected in 1915. Always controversial, his second term was marred by a “rainmaker” fiasco. San Diego was suffering a multi-year drought, and hearing that a rainmaker had previously been successful in Los Angeles, the Mayor hired Charley Hatfield to end the drought. Mr. Hatfield avowed that the City need not pay him if he didn’t achieve his goal. After he seeded the clouds with noxious fumes, rain began to fall, and continued to fall. In January of 1916, San Diego experienced severe flooding and reneged on the deal with Hatfield. Capps, San Diego’s first Democratic mayor, also did some positive things. Trained as a civil engineer, he designed the Spruce Street suspension bridge, the new police station and jail, and came up with the “Capps Plan” to dredge and enlarge the harbor. He was succeeded in 1917 by one of San Diego’s most colorful mayors, Louis J. Wilde.

        Wilde re-named D Street changing it to  Broadway, and prior to becoming mayor, donated the Horton Plaza fountain to the City. His home and the U.S. Grant Hotel were located across from the fountain on Broadway. Wilde’s mayoral campaign against George Marston was dubbed the “smokestacks versus geraniums” campaign, as Wilde tried to paint Marston as anti-growth and business. He claimed Marston was only interested in local beautification and called him “Geranium George.”

        In 1920, while he was Mayor, Wilde hosted a grand debutante ball at the Hotel Del Coronado for his daughter, Lucille. One of the most famous men to visit San Diego, the Prince of Wales, was an attendee at the gala. To get even with his political enemies and others who had snubbed him, Wilde simply did not invite them to come and meet this famous guest. In 1920, Wilde also organized the Community Oil Well Company, which proved to be a dismal failure. Amid scandal he did not seek another term as Mayor, and left town.

        The City remained until 1938, when they relocated to their new headquarters on Harbor Drive at the County Administration Building. In 1964, City Hall moved to 202 C Street.

        After the City departed, the building was used as a storage facility during the WWII years, and later changed owners several times.  The longest running tenant was Thrifty Drug Stores, who did business there from 1944 until 1953.

        In 1957, in an effort to modernize the old building, it was completely covered over in plaster, thus hiding all the beautiful Victorian embellishments. The building was described as a big beige box. Luckily, when the Gaslamp began its restoration, the detailing was uncovered and the structure was returned to its original glory. It was one of the first buildings in the Gaslamp to be fully restored.

        It has housed various popular restaurants on the ground floor throughout the years, but is now currently empty. The upper floors are condos and lofts. Old City Hall still stands as a symbol of the grace and elegance which characterized the Victorian era in early San Diego.

        description: "On December 23, 1867, Dr. John Pierre Backesto, bought himself a Christmas present – a large portion of Block 88 belonging to Alonzo Horton. The property was located on Fifth Avenue and H Street. (now Market St.), and also bordered parts of Fourth Avenue and G Street.  It was subdivided into lots D,E,F,G,H,I, J and K, and comprised an admirable portion of what was to become the heart of San Diego’s growing business district. Dr. Backesto, a physician from San Jose, secured his property for $300, and thus became one of San Diego’s first absentee landlords. He appointed his nephew, George W. Hazzard, as manager of the properties, as it was Hazzard who had introduced his uncle to San Diego.  Within two years, Backesto and Hazzard began to parcel out parts of the lots, including lot J, which was sold to Backesto’s brother, David H. Backesto.

        Hazzard ultimately became quite influential in Republican party politics and business in the area.

        In 1873, Dr. Backesto secured a loan from the Commercial Bank of San Diego and erected his first “fine brick building.”  However, in April of 1884, he hired G.T. Burgett ,a San Jose architect, to design a replacement for the remaining wooden structures on the property and to enlarge the original building. The wood from the wooden buildings was later used in the construction of the new Backesto brick building.  According to his instructions, it incorporated skylights in the upstairs rooms,  “good ventilating apparatus” and seven chimneys for heating.The building featured a series of pedimented window columns with cornices, which were repeated across the great length of the building, and served to give it a majestic appearance. The original structure also incorporated a balustrade along the top story, which was later removed. All foundation walls were of brick. The entire building had a frontage of 100 feet on Market Street, and 224 feet along Fifth.The first estimate for the project was in excess of $20,000, which of course ran over budget. Upon completion, it was said to be the finest mercantile structure in all of San Diego, and some said, in all of California.

        The first tenants of this impressive structure included clothiers, milliners, jewelers, a liquor store, general merchandisers, a hardware store, real estate offices, a photographer’s studio, ship chandlers and steamship companies.  The upper floors housed 39 sleeping rooms.  Klauber and Levi, San Diego’s pioneer grocer and general merchandise firms occupied the building until 1886, and the famous San Diego Hardware opened in this building in 1892. In 1923, San Diego Hardware moved to a building further up Fifth Avenue.

        Dr. Backesto died on March 17, 1890.  His estate, San Diego Realty, was valued at $715,600. The Backesto/Hazzard family retained control of this extensive property until 1930.

        The Backesto Building was one of the first in the Gaslamp to be restored to its original splendor.  The upstairs rooms, now offices, retain the original flavor of the 1880s, while the first floor buildings are now largely restaurants.

        The newest tenant of the Backesto block is American Junkie, which opened in late March.  This bar/restaurant features American bar food, a DJ and a lively atmosphere.

        description: "What’s an odd fellow? I guess we have all known a few, but the odd fellows of the 1800s were a national fraternal order of gentlemen dedicated to “Friendship, Love, and Truth.” Their identifying symbol was a series of interlinking circles alluding to their motto, making them also known as the Triple Link Fraternity. They were both religiously and politically independent. Although the organization was active in England as far back as the 1700s,  the American branch was not organized until 1819 by Thomas Wildey in Baltimore, Maryland. During the period between 1862 – 1920, they were the largest of all fraternal organizations. By 1889, they had lodges in every American state. San Diego’s Lodge 153 boasted such prominent leaders as Alonzo Horton, John Young, John Gray, E. W. Tebbutt, Edward W. Bushyhead,, W.A. Begole and George Hazzard. The Masons were also active in early San Diego , as the San Diego chapter was founded in 1851. They were the first Masonic lodge founded in California, preceding Los Angeles by one year. To this end, the two organizations banded together to finance construction for a large building that could be used by both organizations. The Masonic Building Association was founded in 1872 with James Pierce as President. Mr. Pierce , a civic and political leader, was 1st Vice-president  of the Bank of San Diego (A.E. Horton , President), president of the Chamber of Commerce, and later a representative to the State Assembly.

 

        It was estimated that the stylish classical revival edifice would cost $25,000. Withers and Meyer were contracted for the job of excavating for the foundation and cellar at 73 cents per square yard. The architectural firm of Payne and Lacey were selected to design the building. They had also designed the Horton House Hotel and the Horton Bank structure. However, due to shortage in capital and materials, the actual building was not begun until 9 years later. Finally, on March 7, 1882, the cornerstone was laid. A casket shaped box, as was the custom of the Odd Fellows, was placed in the northeast corner. It contained Masonic and I.O.O.F. documents, newspapers, coins, historical data, a piece of wood from Lebanon, and a piece of stone from Solomon’s Temple. To celebrate the occasion, a joint parade was held by both organizations, which started up D Street (now Broadway), down D Street to 6th Street and down 6th to H Street (now Market Street). The City Guard Brass Band played and the parade was followed by numerous speeches, and finally culminated with the laying of the casket. The master of ceremonies was W.W. Bowers, another prominent San Diego architect. At the conclusion of the festivities, Mr. Bowers announced that $16,000 more was needed to complete the structure, so George Hazzard, prominent business leader and the incorporator of the San Diego Water Company and the City Gas Company paid the difference, thus making him the largest stockholder in the building.



        Upon completion of the project, controversy arose over the quality of some of the construction materials used. Although court action ensued, it was settled by arbitration. The brick came from San Francisco and the roof was built to be totally waterproof and fireproof.



        This iconic structure was designed for street level commercial use, which would then provide financial support for the building. Originally, the building had a 100’ frontage on H Street, with a 63’ frontage on 6th Street, which provided space for 6 stores. The second floor had two large halls (56×30) with 3 anterooms, a library and a chess room. In 1905, the Masons added a 12.5’x85’ room for storage along the back of the north wall. This room had no basement. The basement in the original structure was 8,500 square feet with 8’ tall ceilings and 18” thick walls.



        The first floor has a cast iron base and pilasters to support the structural columns. The second floor was finished in plaster over a 16-inch brick wall. The impressive exterior cornices are plaster over sheet metal and the balconies feature antique wrought iron railings. The unique and heavy arched windows required pipe columns to support the lintels along the roof line.



        Throughout the years, the first floor has housed saloons, wholesale and retail liquor stores, gun shops, book stores, a seed store, dry goods stores, billiard parlors, barbers, tobacco stores, a laundry, shoe repair shops, restaurants, a chili con carne factory and the Wells Fargo Express Company. The Gas Company was one of the original inhabitants of the ground floor, and in 1885, John. C. Daley’s Masonic Building Book Store offered fancy linen paper and envelopes, gold pens, artist’s materials, as well as seals and wax for letters. Mr. Daley also took orders for “magnificent plates of game fishes of the U.S.” for $50 per set. These plates were designed to provide “adornment for parlor or library.” Additionally, at one time the Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO) had its offices there. In 1974, the San Diego Ballet used the second floor, with its elegant wood floors as their headquarters.



        The Masons moved to their new hall at Fifth and Ash in 1910, but the Odd Fellows continued to use the building for many years. They now meet in a much smaller hall in North Park.



        Throughout its colorful history the I.O.O.F. building has hosted many dignitaries, but perhaps one of the most notable was King Kalakaua of Hawaii. He arrived in 1890, as he was touring the mainland and there was talk of Hawaii becoming a state.  He sat by one of the magnificent arched windows and, unfortunately and literally, caught his death of a cold. By the time King Kalakaua reached San Francisco, the cold had developed into pneumonia and he passed away.  It must be noted, however, that the king was known as the “Merry Monarch,” because of his predilection for rich food and drink. He had developed nephritis (kidney disease), which was the underlying cause of his demise.



        A very popular Asian-fusion restaurant now occupies the ground floor.

        description: "The Prohibition Era was a time in American history from 1920-1933 when alcohol was banned across the country. Often referred to as ‘the Noble Experiment’ because of its ultimate failure as a law, this time of secret knocks, whispered passwords and hidden bars still holds a certain charm for cocktail enthusiasts today. Speakeasy-style bars that evoke the mysterious allure of this famous time in history have become popular across major US cities.

        One of the most highly rated speakeasies both for cocktail quality and an authentic Prohibition-era feel in San Diego, California is aptly named The Noble Experiment, located in downtown San Diego’s famous Gaslamp District. Located behind a secret door that appears to be a stack of old beer kegs within the upbeat, casual restaurant Neighborhood Alehouse, and accepting of only very specific reservation methods, this unusual bar is the Gaslamp District’s best-kept secret.
        
        Attire is smart; men will not be allowed in with caps, sandals or shorts, and collared shirts are preferred. Women should embrace the theme as well and arrive in their classy best. Because of the limited seating capacity, reservations are a must. Reservations are recommended to be made one week in advance for Friday and Saturday nights, and one day ahead for weeknights. The reservation style follows the enigmatic feel of the bar. Noble Experiment’s website features nothing more than a picture of a key and a phone number; guests must text this number at precisely one minute after midnight to obtain a reservation. Walk-ins are sometimes accommodated, but reservations are strongly recommended, especially for groups larger than two.
